# Qt-Playground
The Qt Playground is a desktop application that is a test ground for learning, improving & experimenting with the QML programming language. It serves as a test bed as I am learning QML programming.

The design of all elements, that is... components, controls, layout, typography, etc... will follow the Google Material Design 3 design language all throughout.
