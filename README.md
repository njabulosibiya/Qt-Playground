### Outline
The Purpose of this application is to serve as a test bed for new things Iâ€™ve learnt, new ideas and to grow my knowledge & skill on the QML language. All elements in this application will follow the rules of responsiveness & make use of  model-view-delegate. My previous projects, where I was learning the basics of QML, focused only on functionality neglecting appearance. In this project, A proper UI will be designed in Figma. The design of all elements, that is... components, controls, layout, typography, etc... will follow the Google Material Design 3 design language all throughout.
